These scripts create custom controls and camera settings for a flying vehicle.
In order to create custom controls for the vehicle, default avatar controls must be deleted. 
Go to StartPlayers -> StarterPlayerScripts -> PlayerOperationScript and delete the OperationControl script file.
(This is a temporary workaround, a permanent solution to deleting the default avatar will be released soon)
